    "## High on Cloud Wine: Predicting the Quality of Wine\n",
    "From seed to wine, the process of making the said alcohol is said to take up to 5 years before the liquid is bottled and sold to the market for consuming. Moreoever, the sheer level of detail that vintners, or winemakers, need to pay attention to is immense due to the complexities of the taste of the alcohol. A lot of factors goes into this including the type of fruits invovled, the temperature that the fruits were grown in and where the barrels for fermentation were kept, the alcohol content in the drink and a lot more (\"Wine Production\", 2018). This is why it is important to figure out the quality of wine, not only for the producers to assure the quality of their products, but also for consumers as well to decide which wine they should try out as a beginner trying to get into alcoholic drinks, and for sommeliers as well to decide which ones to pair with their meal/s."

    "The [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) (titled **`winequality-red.csv`**) consists of 1600 red and white wine variants of the \"Vinho Verde\" wine from Portugal. The data was retrieved from a study conducted by Cortez, P. et al. and was uploaded and shared to Kaggle by the staff of **UCI Machine Learning Repository** under the same name. Each row available in the dataset consists of values coming from physiochemical and sensory variables. Information about the producers, grape type and selling prices are said to be unavailable due to privacy and logistic reasons."
